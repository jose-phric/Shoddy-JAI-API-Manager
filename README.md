**Shoddy JAI API Manager**

Enhance your JanitorAI chat experience with custom presets! Quickly inject your favorite prompts, models, proxy URLs, and API keys directly into the chat modal using convenient buttons and dropdowns.

**Key Features:**

* **Custom Preset Buttons:** Create and save full chat setups (including prompt, model, proxy, and API key) and inject them with a single click from new buttons appearing in the JanitorAI chat modal.
* **Dynamic Dropdowns:** Access your saved prompts, models, proxy URLs, and API keys via intuitive dropdown menus directly within the JanitorAI modal for quick selection and insertion.
* **Comprehensive Data Management:**
    * **Save & Organize Prompts:** Store your most used custom prompts with descriptive names.
    * **Manage Models:** Keep a list of your preferred models for easy switching.
    * **Store Proxy URLs:** Quickly apply different proxy configurations.
    * **Local API Key Storage:** Save and select your API keys by name.
* **Edit & Delete Functionality:** Easily modify or remove any saved entries directly from the extension's compact, dark-mode friendly popup.
* **Seamless Integration:** Designed to blend visually with the JanitorAI interface, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**How It Works:**

1.  **Open the Extension Popup:** Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
2.  **Add Your Data:** Use the intuitive forms to add new prompts, models, proxy URLs, or API keys.
3.  **Create Presets:** Combine your saved data into powerful "Presets" for one-click setup.
4.  **Use in JanitorAI:** When the JanitorAI chat modal appears, you'll see your custom buttons and dropdowns, ready to inject your saved configurations.

**Please Note:**

* **Content Visibility:** Nothing will appear in the JanitorAI modal (no dropdowns or custom buttons) until you have added at least one corresponding entry (e.g., a prompt, model, proxy URL, API key, or preset) via the extension's popup.
* **Button Location:** Your custom preset buttons will be found at the **bottom of the JanitorAI chat modal**, below the existing JanitorAI preset options.
